# INSTRUCTIONS
NOTES: 
- This LUTs are tailored for DJI Action 2 material although colour rendition may be unique for every single DJI camera model nonetheless this LUTs have been tested to perform well over any sort of random and good quality material which brings to the next points.

- This LUTs add some degree of warmth to the image therefore are expecting a neutral white balanced image, specially for skin colour rendition being already in the warm colour spectrum saturation could build up excessively with pre-warmed or warmed biased white balanced material.

- This LUTs where tested to avoid any breakage to the image in optimum quality conditions but do not expect to perform well if the material already presents artefacts like high ISOs or any compression and zoomed-in issues.

- To download the LUTs simply click over the .zip file in the file menu above and then click in the download button option in the upper right corner.

- For a colour rendition demonstration of the LUTs watch this video montage https://youtu.be/u3WZun1xiSQ if you haven't already been re-directed here from Youtube. And for any feedback feel free to comment in the discussions menu.

INVENTORY:
- "D-CINELIKE BASE IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": although this LUT wasn't used in the video demonstration, it's the base LUT upon the rest of the D-cinelike versions are build over, being the coolest tint of them all it's the most gentle for skin colour rendition including the Normal profile LUTs.

- "D-CINELIKE V2 IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": a beefed up version of the D-CINELIKE BASE LUT, more warm and the main used for all the D-Cinelike scenes in the video. The best LUT for general use.

- "D-CINELIKE V2 SCENE IsaacRC's Blockbuster": simple contrast and saturation adjustments over the D-CINELIKE V2 LUT used in the 7th scene min. 1:27 of the demostrative video, why not include it.

- "NORMAL BASE IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube":

- "GYROFLOW CONVERSION Legal to Full.cube": as of the date of the this LUTs release this utility 1D LUT is needed if importing material from Gyroflow in the video editor and the gamma is mistakenly scaled to Legal levels (lifting the shadows and lowering the sgadows). A simple way to know if you need to apply this LUT before applying the Blockbuster LUTs is importing the original camera material and its Gyroflow stabilized version into the video editor, if the video is not identical and you see it's being scaled to Legal then simply apply this 1D LUT to scale it back to Full levels.
