# INSTRUCTIONS
NOTES: 
- This LUTs are tailored to be used over an exposure bias of -0.3 for the D-Cinelike profile and -1.0 for the Normal profile.

- This LUTs are tailored for DJI Action 2 material although colour rendition may be unique for every single DJI camera model nonetheless this LUTs have been tested to perform well over any sort of random and good quality material which brings to the next points.

- This LUTs add some degree of warmth to the image therefore expect a neutral white balanced image, specially for skin colour rendition being already in the warm colour spectrum saturation could build up excessively with pre-warmed or warmed biased white balanced material.

- This LUTs where tested to avoid any breakage to the image in optimum quality conditions but do not expect to perform well if the material already presents artefacts like high ISOs or any compression and zoomed-in issues.

- This Luts where tailored using the colour rendition of an iMac Retina monitor with a display colur profile of HD 709-A https://youtu.be/YwjLuUR51gE?feature=shared Given the crazy situation that everyone (not professionals) has different consumer monitor colour renditions I truly have no idea how good or totally horrible you may see the LUTs, be advised.

- To download the LUTs simply click over the .zip file in the file menu above and then click in the download button option located in the upper right corner.

- For a colour rendition demonstration of the LUTs watch this video montage https://youtu.be/u3WZun1xiSQ if you haven't already been re-directed here from Youtube. And for any feedback feel free to comment in the discussions menu.

LUTS INVENTORY:
- "D-CINELIKE -0_3 BASE IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": -0_3 means that ideally expects a -0.3 exposure compensation, although this LUT wasn't used in the video demonstration, it's the base LUT upon the rest of the D-cinelike versions are build over, has the coolest temperature of them all so it's the best for skin colour versatility that is including the Normal profile LUTs being the most limited.

- "D-CINELIKE -0_3 V2 IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": a beefed up version of the BASE, more warm and the main used for all the D-Cinelike scenes in the video. The recommended LUT for general use.

- "D-CINELIKE -0_3 V2 SCENE IsaacRC's Blockbuster": minor contrast and saturation adjustments over the V2 LUT made for the 7th scene min. 1:27 of the demostrative video, why not include it.

- "NORMAL -1_0 BASE IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": like all the following Normal profile LUTs expects a -1.0 exposure compensation, it's the base LUT version.

- "NORMAL -1_0 SCENE 01 IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": a minor variation of the BASE made for the 5th and 6th scene min. 0:52 of the demostrative video, why not include it.

- "NORMAL -1_0 SCENE 02 IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": a minor variation of the BASE made for the 8th, 9th and 10th scene min. 1:45 of the demostrative video, why not include it.

- "NORMAL -1_0 SKIN IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": tailored for optimum skin colour rendition, almost a completely different LUT.

- "NORMAL -1_0 SKIN V2 IsaacRC's Blockbuster.cube": a more gentle NORMAL -1_0 SKIN version, less saturated.

- "GYROFLOW CONVERSION Legal to Full.cube": as of the date of the this LUTs release this utility 1D LUT is needed if importing material from Gyroflow in the video editor and the gamma is mistakenly scaled to Legal levels (lifting the shadows and lowering the sgadows). A simple way to know if you need to apply this LUT before applying the Blockbuster LUTs is importing the original camera material and its Gyroflow stabilized version into the video editor, if the video is not identical and you see it's being scaled to Legal then simply apply this 1D LUT to scale it back to Full levels.
