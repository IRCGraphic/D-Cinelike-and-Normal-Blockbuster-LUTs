# INSTRUCTIONS
Â·Important notes: 
- This LUTs are tailored for DJI Action 2 material so colour rendition may be unique for every single DJI camera model nonetheless the LUTs have been tested and perform well over any sort of random and good quality material which brings to the next points.
- 
- This LUTs add some degree of warmth to the image therefore are expecting a neutral white balanced image, specially for skin colour rendition being already this in warm colour spectrum saturation will build up excessively with pre-warmed or warmed biased white balance material.
- 
- This LUTs where tested to avoid any breakage to the image in optimum quality conditions but do not expect to perform well if the material already presents artefacts specially high ISOs or compression artefacts.
